# Privacy Policy for Clawsy

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-06

## 1. Principle: Data Minimalism & Privacy by Design
Clawsy is designed to process data locally on your device or transmit it directly to your own self-hosted OpenClaw instance. We (the developers) do not operate a central server that processes your data.

## 2. Data Processing
- **Screenshots:** Are taken only upon explicit user approval via a system dialog. They are transmitted directly to your configured OpenClaw Agent endpoint.
- **Clipboard:** Clipboard content is read only upon explicit user approval via a system dialog.
- **Files:** Clawsy only accesses folders you explicitly grant permission to.

## 3. Data Transmission
All data transmission occurs directly between the Clawsy app on your Mac and your OpenClaw Agent (e.g., via Tailscale or local network). No data is sent to third-party cloud servers managed by the Clawsy team.

## 4. No Analytics
Clawsy does not contain tracking pixels, analytics SDKs, or telemetry that reports usage data to us.

## 5. Legal Compliance (GDPR/DSGVO)
As a self-hosted tool, you are the data controller. The software acts as a processor under your direct control.
